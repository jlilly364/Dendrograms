Hierarchical Structure Analysis with Astrodendro

Scripts that I have developed since my NRAO REU in Summer 2018 to utilize astrodendro for hierarchical structure analysis. All the scripts are not thoroughly commented so if you have any questions/comments, please feel free to email me at jwlilly@email.arizona.edu

Additionally, the astrodendro webpage has a wealth of useful information about the software and its various applications.
